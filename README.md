# Context Use

[![Deploy on nibrun](https://nibrun.com/button.svg)](https://app.nibrun.com/deploy?name=context-use&port=3000)

Context Use runs on Bun end to end: an Elysia API and a React SPA in one repository,
sharing types across the wire. `bun run build` compiles it all into a **single binary** with the
built frontend and the SQL migrations embedded — nothing to install on the target machine.

## Getting started

### For agents

Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) — the layering, the conventions each side holds to, and what to run
to check your work.

### Repository layout

```text
backend/   Elysia API, business logic, persistence, migrations, and production entrypoint
frontend/  React SPA, typed API client, routes, queries, and UI
```

### For humans

```bash
bun install
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
openssl rand -base64 32   # paste into BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in backend/.env
bun run dev
```

The backend comes up on `:3000` and Vite on `:5173`, proxying `/api` to it — so the browser only
ever talks to one origin, the same arrangement as production, where the backend serves the
frontend itself.

## Features

- **One binary.** The frontend and the migrations are embedded, and the entrypoint is compiled to
  bytecode, so it boots in about half the time at the cost of ~20% more size. Targets linux x64 by
  default; `bun run build:local` compiles for the current machine.
- **Types across the wire.** The client is Eden Treaty's `treaty<App>`, typed from the server
  instance rather than a schema — a route that changes shape breaks the caller at compile time,
  and there is nothing to regenerate.
- **Auth.** better-auth, email and password, storing its tables in the same SQLite database as
  everything else. A route opts in with `.guard({ auth: true })` and gets a resolved `user` and
  `session` on its context, or a `401` before the handler runs.
- **An API reference that can't drift.** `/openapi` serves a [Scalar](https://scalar.com) page and
  `/openapi/json` the spec behind it, both generated from the same TypeBox schemas the routes
  already validate with.
- **SQLite through `Bun.SQL`**, with migrations applied at startup, in order, once.
- **File storage.** Authenticated upload, list, download and delete. Metadata in SQLite, bytes
  streamed off disk by Bun with Range requests included. `Storage` is deliberately a structural
  subset of `Bun.S3Client` — and a compile-time assertion keeps it that way — so moving to real
  object storage is one line in `backend/src/lib/storage/client.ts`.
- **The server serves the SPA.** Every built file is registered as its own native static route, so
  Bun answers `If-None-Match` with a `304` on its own and the hashed assets are `immutable` for a
  year. Anything that matches no file and doesn't look like an API call falls back to `index.html`.

## Deploy the app

`bun run build` produces `backend/dist/app`. It listens on `PORT` and expects the variables in
[backend/.env.example](./backend/.env.example).

Run it on [nibrun](https://nibrun.com): drop the binary, get an HTTPS URL and a disk that survives
every redeploy. No Dockerfile, no YAML, nothing to install next to it. `BASE_URL` can stay unset
there — nibrun injects `NIBRUN_HOSTNAME`, and the app takes `https://<that hostname>` as its
public origin — the origin better-auth trusts and builds its URLs from.
Deployment instructions and platform constraints are versioned in the repository's
[Nibrun skill](./.agents/skills/deploy-to-nibrun/SKILL.md).
